## What is Bloom? <a name="what-is-bloom"></a>
Bloom is a site dedicated to taking the guesswork out of reducing your individual carbon footprint. It acts as an all-in-one resource to: 
* Calculating your carbon footprint based on individual or combined actions; 
* Comparing your footprint to averages; making voluntary donations to environmental organizations based on balancing your carbon emissions; 
* Having quick access to the current air quality and temperature in your area; 
* Learning more about how you can lessen your own environmental impact via infographics and up-to-date news articles; 
* And digging deeper into specific inqueries via our OpenAI-powered chatbot for all things climate change related, Bloom GPT.
